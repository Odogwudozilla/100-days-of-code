### Day 03: April 08, 2018 (Created a landing page on Github)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Just HTML. Cloned the code from another developer.

**Thoughts:** I think I am taking the coding venture too fast and too hot. I need to slow down. The most dangerous knowledge is a little knowledge.
