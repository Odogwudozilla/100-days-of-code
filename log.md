### Day 03: April 08, 2018 (Created a landing page on Github)
#####

**Today's Progress**: Just HTML. Cloned the code from another developer.

**Thoughts:** I think I am taking the coding venture too fast and too hot. I need to slow down. The most dangerous knowledge is a little knowledge.

### Day 04: April 09, 2018 (Read a lot of articles)
#####

**Today's Progress**: Read a "success story" article on Medium and then from there dug into a rabbit hole of article after article until my head was spinning. I also started the Ruby Koans Exercises. These exercises are awesome in the sense that they guide you through the Ruby syntax, gradually bringing you to the "path to enlightenment" bit by bit.

**Thoughts:** Pretty much all the articles say there is really no shortcut to learning to code which does not include putting in the thousands of hours, and that's what I am going to do.

### Day 05: April 10, 2018 (Ruby Koans ti takeover)
#####

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning the Ruby Syntax/Concepts via the Ruby Koans exercises. 

**Thoughts:** The Ruby syntax is becoming clearer. I saw in clear terms how Ruby interpretes strings as arrays meaning you can call each letter in a string as an array.
