### Day 02: April 07, 2018 (Worked on Ruby Exercises)
#####

**Today's Progress**: I can't really say what i learned today. i just know I am still struggling with understanding how loops work in methods.

### Day 03: April 08, 2018 (Created a landing page on Github)
#####

**Today's Progress**: Just HTML. Cloned the code from another developer.

**Thoughts:** I think I am taking the coding venture too fast and too hot. I need to slow down. The most dangerous knowledge is a little knowledge.

### Day 04: April 09, 2018 (Read a lot of articles)
#####

**Today's Progress**: Read a "success story" article on Medium and then from there dug into a rabbit hole of article after article until my head was spinning. I also started the Ruby Koans Exercises. These exercises are awesome in the sense that they guide you through the Ruby syntax, gradually bringing you to the "path to enlightenment" bit by bit.

**Thoughts:** Pretty much all the articles say there is really no shortcut to learning to code which does not include putting in the thousands of hours, and that's what I am going to do.

### Day 05: April 10, 2018 (Ruby Koans ti takeover)
#####

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning the Ruby Syntax/Concepts via the Ruby Koans exercises.

**Thoughts:** The Ruby syntax is becoming clearer. I saw in clear terms how Ruby interpretes strings as arrays meaning you can call each letter in a string as an array.

### Day 06: April 11, 2018 (Ruby Koans)
#####

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning the Ruby Syntax/Concepts via the Ruby Koans exercises.

**Thoughts:** I had a really hard time fully understanding the symbols and the regular expressions. At the end had to coast through them using the hints provided, resolved to make do with the ephemeral understanding of the concepts at the moment.

### Day 07: April 12, 2018 (Ruby Koans)
#####

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning the Ruby Syntax/Concepts via the Ruby Koans exercises.

**Thoughts:** There is still a lot out there to understand. I get some (such as inheritance in methods), while I don't get the keyword arguments. God dey sha.

### Day 08: April 13, 2018 (Ruby Exercises)
#####

**Today's Progress**: Completed the find_even.rb portion of the Ruby exercises that requires a method that returns even numbers in an array, and an empty array if none is found.

**Thoughts:** I discovered the power of Ruby Enumerables. They can save you a lot of headache and lines of code. Several lines of useless if/else statements can be compacted in just one line. You just have to find the right function.

### Day 09: April 15, 2018 (Ruby Exercises)
#####

**Today's Progress**: Completed the blocks, iteration and sandwich (calling methods as blocks in another method) exercises in the Ruby Koans ensemble.

**Thoughts:** The "Sandwich" methods are not too clear for me. I had to coast through them anyway. Better days ahead.

### Day 10: April 16, 2018 (Ruby Exercises)
#####

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "Scoring project" exercise in the Ruby Koans ensemble.  

**Thoughts:** I still have issues with writing clean compact code. Spent substantial time trying to fit the code in block. Did not succeed. Resorted to a coterie of if/else statements.

#####

**Today's Progress**: Completed just one exercise in the Ruby Koans today. Was bogged down with other activities.

### Day 18: April 27, 2018 (Rails Course)
#####

**Today's Progress**: I Got a sneak-peak into the power of rails - the concept of scaffolding behind multi-creation abilities of webapps like this 'tweet'. I may be wrong but if you're very good at this you can create a fully-functional app in days!.

**Thoughts:** One day I will be able to create a fully-functional webapp in two days.
